Create a strategic design for a modified version of the Game Of Life:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>

At the start of the program, the user will provide the following details:
- size of the square grid
- the location of each live cell

The program will display all the cells, live and dead. It will show animation of the birth and death of cells, until the user quits the program.

Assume the grid is fixed size and the program has to show only the state of cells within the given bounds.

Implement the program mentioned above.
